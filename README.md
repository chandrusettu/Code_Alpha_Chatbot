# 🤖 Artificial Intelligence Chatbot (Java)

## 📌 Project Description
This project is a Java-based Artificial Intelligence Chatbot developed for interactive communication with users.  
The chatbot uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as pattern matching and rule-based intent detection to understand user queries and provide suitable responses.  
A Graphical User Interface (GUI) is created using Java Swing to enable real-time interaction.
